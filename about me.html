    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Gaurav Sharma</strong>! I'm from the beautiful <strong>Mandi district in Himachal Pradesh</strong> and currently pursuing my studies at <strong>Lovely Professional University</strong>.</p>
    <p>My passion lies in <strong>game development</strong> and creating immersive, engaging experiences that a community of players can truly enjoy. I envision developing games that aren't just played but are shared and loved by a large, active community.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding or brainstorming new game ideas, I enjoy exploring new games myself. Being around people who share my interest in gaming, like my classmates, keeps me inspired and motivated. I believe that gaming has the power to bring people together, and I'm excited to be a part of this creative and evolving field.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting, and stay tuned for my future projects!</p>
